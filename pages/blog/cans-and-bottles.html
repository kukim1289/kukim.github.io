						<h1>Cans and Bottles</h1>
						<p>How much a dollar cost?</p>
					</header>

					<p>My family always collected and recycled bottles. Visiting home from UCSD, I scrunched water
						bottles and packed them into my duffel bag since I did not have a car to go to a recycling
						center near campus. Once I got home, I drove my family's decade old Hyundai to pick up several
						bags that contained green soju bottles from my father's restaurant along with a basket full of
						bottles that piled up at my mother's house. I collected on average 20-30 dollars that covered
						the train cost to visit home. It was a strange moment at UCSD since my two closest friends did
						not possess the same mindset. Hannam and Justin were both from well off families that did not
						have recycling in their repertoire. Walking back to the apartment from the on campus market, we
						passed by a crushed Starbucks Mocha Can. Even whilst being with my best friends, I feared that
						if I were to pick up the crushed can, I would be labeled as a person who was less fortunate.
						Cans reap the most money at a recycling center at a whopping 10 cents, so I picked up the can
						the next morning while there was no one around to see. Much of my sophomore year was wasted in
						attempt to blend in with my peers who wore expensive clothes and followed Hypebeast trends. Now
						I see the irony in recycling bottles and cans to fund a $120 shoe purchase.</p>
					<p>I was a junior transfer at UC Berkeley when I decided to rush an Asian fraternity. At the end of
						rush week, there was an event that took me to Origin NightClub in San Francisco. While I was
						talking with the brothers in line, there were dollar bills scattered around the floor. I ignored
						the dollar bills in the same fashion that I ignored the crushed mocha can and doing so elicited
						much of the same feelings. I was embarrassed to pick up the dollars to preserve my reputation in
						front of the brothers.</p>
					<p>Mom always reminded me of how large a dollar can be despite social status. Although a dollar may
						be a seemingly insignificant amount, it holds most of its value in reminding me of humbler
						beginnings. A dollar reminds me to practice gratitude for the people and experiences that helped
						me grow. These instances also allow me to form an appreciation for people who aren't afraid of
						judgement and those who regularly practice humility. My mother would never pass by a dime on the
						floor and she owns a house. Why should I ignore a can when I own nothing?</p>
