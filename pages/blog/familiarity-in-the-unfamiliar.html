					<p>"Finding familiarity in the unfamiliar" is a concept that is often discussed when people
						encounter new experiences, such as starting a new job or moving to a new place. For some, it is
						the ability to relate to their new surroundings and make it feel like home. For me, finding
						familiarity in the unfamiliar is all about connecting with people.</p>
					<p>When most people talk about finding familiarity in the unfamiliar, it can be during moments such
						as finding a new job, moving to another country, or learning something new. Finding familiarity
						in the unfamiliar lets people feel a sense of comfort, security, or even a sense of direction.
						For instance, when a person moves to a new country, they try to relate their experiences and
						knowledge of their home to the new place that they live. It helps them navigate further into
						their new place, and lets them feel that there really is not much difference between the two.</p>
					<p>To me, finding familiarity in the unfamiliar involves interacting with people. I find it most
						satisfying to connect with people by not seeing them as strangers. I try to draw parallels
						between that person and people in my life. By doing this, I feel like I have much more wholesome
						and thorough conversations and the ability to express myself as I am.</p>
					<p>I was driving to school and noticed that the tire pressure monitor alert had gone off. I got off
						the freeway and went to a nearby Costco to fill up the air. There was a woman in her 50s who was
						also trying to fill air in her tires at the air pump next to mine. It looked as if she was
						concerned and wanted some help from workers at the tire center, but all of them were too busy to
						assist her. I could have simply filled up my tires and been on my way, but I felt a sense of
						responsibility to ask her if she needed help. She reminded me of my own mother. She drove the
						same Lexus SUV and had the same expeditious walk that almost every Asian mom seems to have. When
						I asked her if she needed help, her face lit up and she asked me how much she should inflate her
						tires. I asked her to sit in her car and turn it on so she could navigate to the tire pressure
						menu. I also showed her the recommended fill pressure that is located on the side of her door. I
						taught her these things, in the same way I would teach my mom. I filled her four tires, and
						after I was done, she told me that her son was my age and that I reminded her of him. We saw
						familiarity in one another as total strangers. However, I felt that our interaction was much
						more meaningful and thorough than if I were to help her in the manner of teaching a stranger.</p>
					<p>I was riding my motorcycle around Berkeley. I had finished my classes for the week, so I had a
						few hours to ride up to Grizzly Peak. As I came down the mountain, I decided to ride around the
						downtown area of Berkeley for the ambiance. As I turned the corner to ride down Telegraph
						Avenue, I noticed a child looking at me and waving profusely. I saw him out of the corner of my
						eye, so I couldn't wave back in time. I decided to turn the corner again and make my way around
						to the one-way street that he was on. I rode up to him and gestured for him to come and rev the
						motorcycle. He was unsure at first, but then I remembered that I was wearing a black leather
						race suit with a black helmet, and I realized that I might look intimidating to a four or
						five-year-old. I raised my visor and showed a smile through my eyes. His grandpa was with him,
						holding his hand, and he gave his grandson reassurance and gestured for him to rev the
						motorcycle. The boy, who was no taller than the handlebars of the bike, reached up and twisted
						the throttle. He scared himself with how loud the motorcycle was, and his grandpa laughed as we
						shared a wholesome moment. The grandpa reached out his hand in the gesture of a high-five, so I
						held up my hand, and he grasped it. He did one of those Gordon Ramsay high-five handholds
						instead of a high-five. He came close and said, "Thank you."</p>
					<p>Finding familiarity in the unfamiliar can be a rewarding experience, especially when it comes to
						connecting with others. By drawing parallels between strangers and people in my life, I can make
						meaningful connections that go beyond the surface level. My encounters with a woman filling air
						in her tires and a child waving at me while I was riding my motorcycle are perfect examples of
						how finding familiarity in the unfamiliar can lead to wholesome and memorable interactions. In a
						world where strangers are often viewed with suspicion and caution, finding familiarity in the
						unfamiliar is a refreshing reminder of the kindness that exists in people.</p>
