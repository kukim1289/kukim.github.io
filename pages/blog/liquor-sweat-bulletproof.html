					<p>A mile east of where the 5 merges with the San Bernardino freeway is Duke's Sportsman Liquor
						store. Duke and Sunny, my middle aged parents from South Korea, owned the small liquor store in
						the city of Terrace for nearly a decade. Sitting on a stool behind the hanging rolls of
						scratchers, I watched my parents work. My dad, with his toes exposed in his velcro sandals,
						greeted customers while talking with the Budweiser courier about the day's shipment. My mother
						stood at the counter behind the bullet proof glass for hours on end, shifting her weight from
						one leg to the other to spare her aching muscles. Occasionally, a regular customer walked in and
						greeted me. "Duke Junior" is the title I was given as I had some of my father's strong Korean
						features: monolids and pronounced cheekbones. Around sunset, my mother and I left the store. As
						we reversed out of the parking lot, my father stood and waved goodbye. On the radio was 50
						cent's "In da Club" and my mother left the windows of the Chevy wide open almost as if she was
						letting the wind evaporate the day's sweat.</p>
					
					<p>2005. Royalty Market, located in the heart of South Central LA on 62nd and San Pedro, was much
						different than Duke's liquor. The glass got thicker, the ailes grew larger, and the weekends
						were no longer spent as a spectator as I frequented Ace wholesale with my mother to pick up a
						variety of vegetables, sodas, dairy, and cigarettes. We were regulars at the wholesale. The
						workers gave my mother a suitable nickname: "Royalty!", but I retained my title as Duke Junior.
						With an increased workload, my parents placed a queen size bed in the storage attic to sleep
						overnight, while leaving my sister and me with my grandma back at home in the San Fernando
						Valley. This was the busiest and most dangerous period in my parents' lives. An altercation with
						a customer led to a black eye and missing front teeth for my father. It was a common sight to
						see red salonpas along the back of my father's neck or around my mother's forearms.</p>

					<p>I am proud of achieving a closer resemblance to my parents.</p>
